# Logger Multiplatform library

## What is it?

This repository facilitates logging and storing the generated log file on Firebase. We use [Kotlin Multiplatform](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/multiplatform.html) library that is deployable to [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/).

The library has the following functions. Also, it has a test for each platform just to be sure that tests run.
1. log(message: String) - logs the message to the console.
2. logToFile(message: String) - logs the message to a file.
3. uploadLogToFirebase() - uploads the log file to Firebase.

This repository's forked from the [Kotlin Multiplatform Library Template](https://github.com/Kotlin/multiplatform-library-template).
